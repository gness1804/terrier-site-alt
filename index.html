      <p><a href="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/cairn-terrier/" target="_blank">Cairn Terriers</a> are a breed of dog originating in Scotland. They are small in size and known for their assertive, hardy, and independent demeanors. They have an average weight of about 18 lb and their average lifespan is 10-13 years.</p>
      <p>Cairns are not for everyone: they are notoriously hard to train, require lots of exercise and attention, and require moderate amounts of grooming. But the reward for all this effort is a friend for life!</p>
      <p>Who is the best known Cairn Terrier of all time? Probably Terry, the dog who played Toto in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i> Dorothy's delightful companion in this all-time classic film showcases many of the key traits of Cairns: loyalty, affection, courage, and relentless spirit. According to Terry's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_(dog)" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a>, the dog appeared in 16 movies over the span of his illustrious career.</p>
